In April 2023, LangChain had incorporated and the new startup raised over $20 million in funding at a valuation of at least $200 million from venture firm Sequoia Capital, a week after announcing a $10 million seed investment from Benchmark.[3][4]\\n The project quickly garnered popularity, with improvements from hundreds of contributors on GitHub, trending discussions on Twitter, lively activity on the project\\'s Discord server, many YouTube tutorials, and meetups in San Francisco and London.

To do that, machine learning engineers must integrate the LLM with the organization’s internal data sources and apply prompt engineering—a practice where a data scientist refines inputs to a generative model with a specific structure and context.\\n How does LangChain work?\\nWith LangChain, developers can adapt a language model flexibly to specific business contexts by designating steps required to produce the desired outcome.\\n Examples of links include:\\nIn the LangChain framework, a link accepts input from the user and passes it to the LangChain libraries for processing.
